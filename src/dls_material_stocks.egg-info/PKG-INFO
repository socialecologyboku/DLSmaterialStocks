# DLS Material Stocks

Analysis of material requirements for decent living standards globally.

This is the code repository for the paper: **"Small increases in society's material stocks to achieve decent living standards globally"** by Streeck et al.

## Installation

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a new virtual environment, e.g. via conda:**

   ```bash
   conda create -n dls-materials python=3.11
   conda activate dls-materials
   ```

   This new environment needs to have Python / pip installed.
2. **Install the package in development mode:**

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   This will install all necessary requirements to run the code. The -e flag installs in development mode, which means you can alter the code and it will reload automatically.
3. **Verify installation:**

   ```bash
   conda list dls-material-stocks
   ```

## Usage

The repository contains all the input files needed to run different DLS scenarios. The scenario data is created via scripts/create_scenario_data.py. This will create pickles of the input data needed to compute the scenarios. Once created, you can use scripts/run_scenarios.py to examine different combinations of practices and thresholds. Running a scenario will save the entire outputs in an .xlsx file and create all figures used in the article for that specific combination. By default, displaying the figures is disabled - activate a matplotlib backend to show them.

In the scripts all scenarios are active, which results in a fairly long runtime. Adapt this to your needs if you are interested in only parts of the output.
